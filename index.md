# Charge Noise in Spin Qubits

**Experimental characterization and ab-initio simulation of charge noise**

Charge noise represents arguably the biggest obstacle to large-scale spin qubit devices. Our research focuses on both experimental characterization and ab-initio simulation to understand, model, and mitigate charge noise effects in quantum dot systems.

## Elevator Pitch

Charge noise is the primary source of decoherence in semiconductor spin qubits, limiting their performance and scalability. Our research tackles this fundamental challenge through:

- **Comprehensive noise characterization** using advanced experimental techniques
- **Ab-initio simulation methods** for understanding noise origins and dynamics
- **Spatial correlation analysis** to map noise landscapes across devices
- **Mitigation strategies** including dynamical decoupling and optimal control
- **Device optimization** through noise-aware design principles

By combining experimental insights with theoretical modeling, we're developing the tools and knowledge needed to build robust, scalable quantum processors.
